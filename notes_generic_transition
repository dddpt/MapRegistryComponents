transition to generic todo
--------------------------------

catastici/cadaster specific architecture:
- mapStyles inside map component folder
- cadastici/cadaster search components inside src folder
- pages
- Map showRasterButton
- navbar
- App

problematic about it:
- easy integration of dataset-specific components into generic architecture?
- rapid coding

proposition
- DONE move Routes.js in pages/ folder (and rename it to website/)
- DONE mapStyle becomes a props of the Map component
- DONE rename the components/ folder to MapRegistryComponents/
    -> DONE fork it to a new git repo
        -> DONE move showRasterButton in cadaster-interface
    -> DONE App.js is a mock-example of integration based on catastici/cadaster
    -> DONE MapRegistryComponents/ is a git submodule of cadaster/catastici and of new apps
